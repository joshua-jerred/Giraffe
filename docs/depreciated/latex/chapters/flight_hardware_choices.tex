\section{Primary Computer}

Given the requirements for the primary computer, the logical choice is the
Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W. With a small form factor, low power consumption, and
plenty of processing power, the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W fit the requirements
while supporting the software requirements.

The original Raspberry Pi Zero W was considered, but the software support
was lacking and it was a task to get the flight software to compile and run
at all.

\section{Power Supply Package}

For the power supply, the decision was made to use 21700 lithium ion batteries
in parallel. These cells have a voltage range of 2.5V to 4.2V, which would
require a boost converter.
